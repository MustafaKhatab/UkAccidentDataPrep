# UkAccidentDataPrep
In this jupyter notebook, I explore the Uk 2015 Dataset and ask question about this dataset and try to visualize them. I later observe the missing rows, outlier and duplicate.
After observing them I try to find the most appropriate method to impute this missing data or drop them entirely. Later, I encode the data and normalize and export this dataset.
